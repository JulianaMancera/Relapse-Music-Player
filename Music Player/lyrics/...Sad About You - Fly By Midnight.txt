I'm going out all right east side lower trying to feel high tonight
I ride the four with a forty subway sober drunk when I arrive
And I swear I'm having a good time
Cause my friends they're having a good time
My face is numb from smiling
Year to year inside I'm dying so

Don't take me home keep me out black me out again
Hide the phone keep it loud drown me out again
Cause when I'm alone I'm stuck in the middle of

Happy about everything else, sad about you
Happy around everyone else so sad about you

I'm coming down just fine dust don't settle don't know how to say goodbye
You're moving on that's cool you're a heartbreak rebel I'm hoping that's all a lie
Cause I swear we had such a good time
And I swear we met at the wrong time
My fingers numb from dialing
Day to day inside I'm dying so

Don't take me home keep me out black me out again
Hide the phone keep it loud drown me out again
Cause when I'm alone I'm stuck in the middle of

Happy about everything else, sad about you
Happy around everyone else so sad without you

I'm so sad about it
Oh I'm so sad about you yeah
I'm so sad about it
Oh I'm so sad about you yeah
I'm so sad about it
Oh I'm so sad about you yeah
I'm so sad about it
Oh I'm so sad about you yeah

Stumbling home
I'm kicking sidewalk stones
Now every midnight's cold
Smile through frozen blue
Without you
Stumbling home
I'm kicking sidewalk stones
Now every midnight's cold
Smile through frozen blue
Without you
