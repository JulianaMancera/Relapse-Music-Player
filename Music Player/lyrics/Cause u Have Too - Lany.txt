'Cause You Have To
Song by

LANY

Chasing a heart is like chasing a ghost
You can't make somebody you love feel the same
If they don't
It doesn't matter the words that you say
'Cause, just like the seasons, you can't stop the way
People change

I'd drive through the night, walk a thousand miles
To feel your head on my chest
I'd give anything, that's what's killing me
'Cause you won't even reach across the bed

The silence is getting too cold
We stopped fighting 'cause deep down inside we both know
Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
Do you only love me 'cause you have to?

All of your friends now were all of mine first
Your mom and your dad they were both there for me
When mine weren't
I can't see tomorrow without you today
I'd rather let you go than make you feel like you've gotta stay

I'd drive through the night, walk a thousand miles
To feel your head on my chest
I'd give anything, that's what's killing me
'Cause you won't even reach across the bed

The silence is getting too cold
We stopped fighting 'cause deep down inside we both know
Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
Do you only love me 'cause you have to?

So, come on, don't be afraid
To break my heart, it only gets worse if you wait
So, just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
Do you only love me 'cause you have to?

(Never)
(I'll never know)
(Never) I'll never know
I'll never know, I'll never know (I'll never know)

I'm so sorry, I wish I could be
The one to love you more (I'll never know)
I hope you find somebody who's got
Everything you're searching for

The silence is getting too cold
We stopped fighting 'cause deep down inside we both know
Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth?
Do you only love me 'cause you have to?
