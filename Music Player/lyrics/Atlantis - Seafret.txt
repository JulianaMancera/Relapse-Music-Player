The birds have left the trees, the light bores onto me
I can feel you lying there all on your own
We got here the hard way, all those words that we exchange
Is it any wonder things get dark?

'Cause in my heart and in my head, I'll never take back the things I said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, "In my heart and in my head, tell me why this has to end"
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis
We fall, we built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis
Oh, no, we built it up to pull it down

Now all the birds have fled, the hurt just leaves me scared
Losing everything I've ever known
It's all become too much, maybe I'm not built for love
If I knew that I could reach you, I would go

It's in my heart and in my head, you can't take back the things you said
So high above, I feel it coming down
She said, "In my heart and in my head, tell me why this has to end"
Oh, no, oh, no

I can't save us, my Atlantis
We fall, we built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us, my Atlantis
Oh, no, we built it up to pull it down

Yeah, we built it up and we built it up
Yeah, we built it up to pull it down
And we built it up and we built it up
And we built it up to pull it down

I can't save us (save), my Atlantis
We fall, we built this town on shaky ground
I can't save us (I can't save), my Atlantis
Oh, no, we built it up to pull it down
