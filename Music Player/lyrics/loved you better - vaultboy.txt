Broken, all the passion
Every day is another distraction
From the way that I reacted
Now the only way I can remember you is in the past tense
I've been acting like I'm past it
When I'm not even close to detached yet
God, I miss it and the person I was when I had it

Had you
I want you to know
I wish I loved you better
Oh, I wish I loved you better
Had you
I want you to know
I wish I loved you better
Oh, I wish I loved you better

Tragic, how it ended
Saying things we don't mean and my dumb self-esteem
Had me crashing like a comet
And destroying the life that we built like it didn't even happen
I'm not asking for forgiveness
'Cause we both know that I don't deserve it
But I miss it and the person I was when I had it

Had you (Had you)
I want you to know
I wish I loved you better
Oh, I wish I loved you better
Had you
I want you to know
I wish I loved you better
Oh, I wish I loved you better (Loved you better)

Running out, I'm running up the cost
A funeral for everything I lost
You called it off, I know that you exhausted all your options
So this is it, the life I couldn't save
I'm paying for all of my mistakes
The love of mine, the one that got away

I miss when when I had you
I want you to know
I wish I loved you better
Oh, I wish I loved you better
