Crush
Song by

David Archuleta

Ooh, whoa, whoa
Ooh, whoa

I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside, it was a rush
What a rush (what a rush)

'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
It's just too much
Just too much (just too much)

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You've got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think, when you're all alone
All that we could be, where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch your breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back, like the way I do?
'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hangin', spendin' time girl
Are we just friends? Is there more?
Is there more? (Is there more?)

See, it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe that we can make this into
Something that will last, last forever
Forever

Do you ever think, when you're all alone
All that we could be, where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch your breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back, like the way I do?
'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah

Why do I keep running from the truth? (Why do I keep running?)
All I ever think about is you (all I ever think about)
You've got my hypnotized (hypnotized)
So mesmerized (mesmerized)
And I just got to know

Do you ever think (ever think), when you're all alone (all alone)
All that we could be, where this thing could go? (Go)
Am I crazy or falling in love? (Crazy)
Is it real or just another crush? (Another crush)
Do you catch your breath when I look at you? (Yeah, yeah)
Are you holding back, like the way I do?
'Cause I've tried and tried to walk away (whoa)
But I know this crush ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah
(This crush ain't) goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah (goin' away)

Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah (do you ever think, when you're all alone)
(All that we could be, where this thing could go?)
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah (do you catch your breath when I look at you?)
(Are you holding back, like the way I do?)
Goin' away, yeah, yeah, yeah (do you ever think, when you're all alone)
(All that we could be, where this thing could go?)
