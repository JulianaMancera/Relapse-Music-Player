I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing games, what's this all about

And I can't believe,
You're hurting me
I met your girl,
What a difference

What you see in her
You ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all
Just make-believe

Oh, love
Never knew what I was missing
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found, found you

Now you're gone, what am I gonna do
So empty my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around
Please tell me baby
Why you go so far away
Why you go

Love
Never knew what I was missing
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found, I found you

Who would have known I'd find you?

Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on baby without you

Rainy days fade away
When you come around
Say you're here to stay
With me boy
I don't want you to leave me
I need you

Love
Never knew what I was missing
I never knew
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found love
Never knew what I was missin'
I never, I never knew
But I knew once we start kissin'
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found I found love
Never knew what I was missing
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found
