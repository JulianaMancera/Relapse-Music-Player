Good Parts
Song by

LANY

Say what you wanna say
You can set a fire to my name
Talk about all the times I made you sad
And all of my mistakes

I was there to catch every teardrop falling from your pretty eyes
You never had to wonder where I stood, I was always one step behind
And you know I fought for us and fought for every night
There's a reason that our love made it all that time
'Cause you can't tango alone, it takes two, there's another side

So say what you wanna say
You can set a fire to my name
Talk about all the times I made you sad
And all of my mistakes

But I hope every night
Baby, just between you and I
When you're all alone and laying in the dark
You remember all the good parts

So I don't care to campaign for myself
I don't need to keep all your friends
We don't feel the same, but come on, babe
Neither one of us are innocent

There's not a thing that I would change if I went back again
There's nothing good about goodbyes, they're never in the plan
But I will always love you and always hate that it had to end

So say what you wanna say
You can set a fire to my name
Talk about all the times I made you sad
And all of my mistakes

But I hope every night
Baby, just between you and I
When you're all alone and laying in the dark
You remember all the good parts

Ooh-ooh
I know you remember, yeah
Ooh-ooh
I know you remember, yeah
When you're all alone and laying in the dark
You remember all the good parts

Ooh-ooh
I know you remember, yeah (baby, baby, yeah)
Ooh-ooh
I know you remember, yeah
When you're all alone and laying in the dark (when you're all alone)
You remember all the good parts (baby, baby)

So say what you wanna say
You can set a fire to my name
Talk about all the times I made you sad
And all of my mistakes

But I hope every night
Baby, just between you and I
When you're all alone and laying in the dark
You remember all
When you're all alone and laying in the dark
You remember all
When you're all alone and laying in the dark
You remember all the good parts
